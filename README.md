# Software Renderer

This is a software renderer written from scratch with minimal external dependencies in C++11 that loosely repeats the structure of the OpenGL library. I wrote this mainly to know how OpenGL works and better understand rendering pipeline and basics of computer graphics.

## Features

+ Triangle rasterization (implemented with barycentric coordinates)
+ Perspective projection
+ Homogeneous clipping
+ Back-face culling
+ Depth testing
+ Alpha testing
+ Alpha blending
+ Cubemapped skybox
+ Blinnâ€“Phong reflection model
+ Movable camera
